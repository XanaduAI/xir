XIR is an intermediate representation language which aims to support the
following workflows:

* Describe the supported operations of a quantum device.

* Intuitively model qubit-based and continuous-variable quantum circuits.

* Serialize high-level representations of quantum circuits in a human-readable format.

Follow the `development guide <../dev/guide.html>`_ to get XIR up and running
and then have a look at the quickstart tutorials to see what you can do with XIR.
