## Release 0.1.1 (development release)

### New features since last release

### Improvements

* The maximum wire value used in a statement within a definition will be the number of wires
  declared. For example, if a single statement within a definition is applied to wire 4, then the
  declared wires will be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Bug Fixes

* Wires are implicitly added to an observable if they are not explicitly declared.

* Validation now checks that applied wires is a subset of declared wires.
