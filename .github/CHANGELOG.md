## Release 0.2.0 (development release)

### New features since last release

### Improvements

* The maximum wire value used in a statement within a definition will be the number of wires
  declared. E.g., if, within a definition, a single statement is applied on wire 4, then the
  declared wires will be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Bug Fixes

* Wires are implicitly added to the declaration if not explicitly declared in a definition.
  [(#2)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/xir/pull/2)

* Validation now checks that applied wires is a subset of declared wires (they don't need to be
  equal).
